		Q: What does this error mean?

		<pre>
error: invalid conversion from 'char' to 'const char*'
</pre>
	</dt>
	<dd>
		A: You are trying to use a <code>char</code> in place of a <code>string</code>.
		You can convert a <code>char</code> into a <code>string</code> if necessary by doing something like this:

		<pre>
char c = 'Q';
string s;
s += c;    // &quot;Q&quot;
</pre>

or,

		<pre>
string s = string(&quot;&quot;) + c;
</pre>

		Q: How efficient must my computer word search be?
		Mine takes up to a few minutes to run; is this okay?
	</dt>
	<dd>
		A: It should finish running almost immediately.
		If your solution takes more than a few seconds to run, something is wrong and you should fix it if you want to receive full credit.
