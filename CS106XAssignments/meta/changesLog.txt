Changes to the writeup for milestone #2
We fixed the function call in the writeup to match the function call in the starter code (in the handout it preveously listed the inputs as ints).
We changed the writeup so that it no longer says the meta.cpp file will prompt the user for the order (instead the order is predetermined).

Changes to the starter code
We added the command w.clear(); to line 128 of meta.cpp. This clears the canvas between each Serpinskii call.
We put some small fixes to the cs106b-prereq.txt file to make it more realistic :)

Changes to writeup for milestone #3
We fixed some grammar issues and rewrote part of the milestone to clarify what you had to do.
