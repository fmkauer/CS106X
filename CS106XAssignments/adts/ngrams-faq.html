<dl>
	<dt id="recursion">
		Q: Can I use recursion on this assignment?
	</dt>
	<dd>
		A: No.  Do not use recursion (functions that call themselves).
	</dd>

	<dt id="compoundcollection">
		Q: How do I construct a compound collection?
		It doesn't compile.
	</dt>
	<dd>
		A: You need a space between nested <code>&lt;&gt;</code>.

		<pre>
Vector&lt;Vector&lt;int&gt;&gt; foo;    // no
Vector&lt;Vector&lt;int&gt; &gt; foo;   // yes
</pre>
	</dd>

	<dt id="print042">
		Q: When I print out a collection, I see weird symbols like <code>\042</code>.  Is it a bug?  What does it mean?
	</dt>
	<dd>
		A: You can ignore that.
		Those are just special character codes for characters like quotation marks.
	</dd>

	<dt id="random">
		Q: How do I get a random number?
	</dt>
	<dd>
		A:

		<pre class="cpp">
#include "random.h"
...

int r = <strong>randomInteger</strong>(min, max);   // inclusive
</pre>
	</dd>

	<dt id="random">
		Q: How do I get a random element of a collection?
	</dt>
	<dd>
		A: If it's an indexed collection, such as a <code>Vector</code>, just pick a random index and then go access that index.
		If it doesn't have indexes, like a set or queue, pick a random index based on the size, and then advance forward (e.g. in a <code>foreach</code> or <code>while</code> loop) that many times and grab the element found there.
	</dd>

	<dt id="whichcollectiontouse">
		Q: Do I have to use the exact collections the spec says to use?
		I want to use a different one.
	</dt>
	<dd>
		A: Follow the spec.
	</dd>

	<dt id="myinputtxt">
		Q: What should go in my <code>myinput.txt</code> file?
	</dt>
	<dd>
		A: Copy/paste a fun source of text from the web.
		For example, grab lyrics from your favorite band, or text of a book or movie script you like, or just make up any text you want.
	</dd>

	<dt id="myinputtxtturnin">
		Q: When I try to turn in the <span class="filename">myinput.txt</span> file, the system doesn't display it.
		Did the turnin system accept my file?
	</dt>
	<dd>
		A: Check the page that displays information about your past submission.
		Do you see the text file there?
		If so, we received it successfully.
		If not, you may need to submit again.
		Sometimes this issue comes from the input file being very large (over ~2mb).
	</dd>

	<dt id="stl">
		Q: Can I use one of the STL containers from the C++ standard library?
	</dt>
	<dd>
		A: No.
	</dd>

	<dt id="advancedmaterial">
		Q: I already know a lot of C/C++ from my previous programming experience.
		Can I use advanced features, such as pointers, on this assignment?
	</dt>
	<dd>
		A: No; you should limit yourself to using the material that was taught in class so far.
	</dd>

	<dt id="files">
		Q: Can I add any other files to the program?
		Can I add some classes to the program?
	</dt>
	<dd>
		A: No; you should limit yourself to the files and functions in the spec.
	</dd>
