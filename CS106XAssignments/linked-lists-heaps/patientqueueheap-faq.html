		Q: How do I compare strings to see which comes earlier in ABC order?
	</dt>
	<dd>
		A: C++ string objects support the standard comparison operators like &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=, ==, and != .

		Q: How can I implement <code>operator &lt;&lt;</code> for printing a priority queue?
		It seems like the operator would need access to the private data inside of the priority queue object.
	</dt>
	<dd>
		A: The <code>&lt;&lt;</code> operator in our assignment is declared with a special keyword called <code>friend</code> that makes it so that this operator is able to directly access the private data inside the priority queue if needed.

	<dt id="destructor">
		Q: What am I supposed to do in a destructor?
	</dt>
	<dd>
		A: Free up any dynamic memory that you previously allocated with the <code>new</code> keyword.

	<dt id="destructorvsclear">
		Q: What is the difference between a destructor and the <code>clear</code> method?
		Don't they do the same thing, deleting all elements from the queue?
	</dt>
	<dd>
		A: A <code>clear</code> method is called explicitly when a client wants to wipe the elements and then start over and use the same list to store something else.
		A destructor is called implicitly by C++ when an object is being thrown away forever; it won't ever be used to store anything else after that.
		The implementations might be similar, but their external purpose is different.
